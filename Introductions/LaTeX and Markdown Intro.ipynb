    "## Introduction to \\LaTeX Math Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks integrate the MathJax Javascript library in order to render mathematical formulas and symbols in the same way as one would in \\LaTeX (often used to typeset textbooks, research papers, or other technical documents).\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will take a look at a couple of rendered expressions and the corresponding way to render these in your notebooks, then follow-up with a few exercises which will help you become more familiar with these tools and their corresponding documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a common expression used in neural networks is the _weighted sum_ rendered as so:\n",
    "\n",
    "$y=\\sum_{i=1}^{N}{w_i x_i + b}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the variable $y$ is calculating the sum of the elements for a vector, $x_i$, each multiplied by a corresponding weight, $w_i$. An additional scalar term, $b$, known as the _bias_ is added to the overall result as well. This expression is more commonly written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$y=\\boldsymbol{w}\\boldsymbol{x}+b$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\boldsymbol{w}$ and $\\boldsymbol{x}$ are both vectors of length $N$. Note the subtle difference in the notation where __ _vectors_ __ are in bold italic, while _scalars_ are only in italic.\n",
    "\n",
    "These kinds of expressions can be rendered in your notebook by creating _markdown_ cells and populating them with the proper expressions. Normally, a cell in a Jupyter notebook is for code that you would like to hand off to the interpreter, but there is a drop-down menu at the top of the current notebook which can change the mode of the current cell to either _code_, _markdown_, or _raw_. We will rarely use _raw_ cells, but the _code_ and _markdown_ types are both quite useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "To render both of the two expressions above, you will need to create a markdown cell, and then enter the following code into the cell:\n",
    "```\n",
    "$y = \\sum_{i=1}^{N}{w_i x_i + b}$\n",
    "$y = \\boldsymbol{w}\\boldsymbol{x}+b$\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You should notice first that each expression is surrounded by a set of \\$ symbols. Any text that you type between two \\$ symbols is rendered using the \\LaTeX mathematics mode. \\LaTeX is a complete document preparation system that we will learn more about later in the semester. For now, the important thing to understand is that it has a special mode and markup language used to render mathematical expressions, and this markup language is supported in _markdown_ cells in Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, you can see that special mathematical symbols such as a summation ($\\sum$) can be rendered using the \"sum\" escape sequence (\\\\sum) where \\\\ is the math mode escape character. There are numerous different escape sequences that can be used in math mode, each representing a common mathematical symbol or operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, you can see that symbols can be attached to other symbols for rendering as sub- or super-scripts by using the _ and ^ operators, respectively. You can also use curly-braces (liberally) to group symbols together into these sub- or super-scripts and the curly-braces, themselves, will not be rendered in the equation. These delimeters only help the math mode interpreter understand which symbols you would like grouped together, and won't be displayed unless escaped.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it is clear that many symbols are rendered in a way that makes intuitive sense. For example, the bias term, $b$, is simply provided with no markup. Any text __not__ escaped or otherwise marked up will be rendered as a standard scalar is rendered (italic). However, the `\\text{}` sequence can be used to render standard text when required. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "`$a\\ \\text{plus}\\ b$`\n",
    "\n",
    "$a\\ \\text{plus}\\ b$\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice also how a backslash followed by a space will add a space between the words. Normally, when two scalars are presented, it is assumed they are being multiplied together, and are placed closely to represent this fact. However, since ext\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few other examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "`$\\boldsymbol{A}=\\boldsymbol{U}\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}\\boldsymbol{V}^\\top$`\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\boldsymbol{A}=\\boldsymbol{U}\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}\\boldsymbol{V}^\\top$ \n",
    "\n",
    "`$\\alpha \\beta \\Theta \\Omega$`\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\alpha \\beta \\Theta \\Omega$\n",
    "\n",
    "`$\\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} \\sin{x}\\ dx$`\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} \\sin{x}\\ dx$\n",
    "\n",
    "`$\\prod_{i=1}^{N}{(x_i+y_i)^2}$`\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\prod_{i=1}^{N}{(x_i+y_i)^2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "`$f(x)=\\frac{1}{x^2}$`\n",
    "\n",
    "$f(x)=\\frac{1}{x^2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "`$\\frac{d}{dx}f(x) = -\\frac{2}{x^3}$`\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{d}{dx}f(x) = -\\frac{2}{x^3}$"

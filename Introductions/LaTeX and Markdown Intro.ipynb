    "## Introduction to $\\LaTeX$ Math Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "Often in our neural net work (yes, I will use this joke far too frequently) we will need to express the mathematical underpinnings of our work in a convenient form. Jupyter notebooks integrate the MathJax Javascript library in order to render mathematical formulas and symbols in the same way as one would in $\\LaTeX$: document preparation software often used to typeset textbooks, research papers, or other technical documents. We will look more into $\\LaTeX$ later in the semester, and only focus on rendering mathematical expressions in JupyterLab for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will take a look at a couple of rendered expressions and then examine the corresponding way to render these in the notebook. After that, we will perform some follow-up exercises which will help you become more familiar with these tools and their corresponding documentation. Learning to read and utilize documentation is __very__ important anytime you are learning new skills, so do not excuse yourself to work from memory alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin by learning how to render a mathematical expression using __markdown cells__ and $\\LaTeX$ formattting syntax. A common expression used in neural networks is the _weighted sum_ or _net input_ of a neuron rendered as so:\n",
    "\n",
    "$y=\\sum_{i=1}^{N}{w_i x_i + b}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the variable $y$ will be the result of the _weighted sum_ of the elements in the vector, $\\boldsymbol{x}$. This means that each element of the vector, $x_i$, is multiplied by a corresponding weight, $w_i$. An additional scalar term, $b$, known as the _bias_ is added to the overall result as well. This expression is more commonly written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$y=\\boldsymbol{w}\\boldsymbol{x}+b$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\boldsymbol{w}$ and $\\boldsymbol{x}$ are both vectors of length $N$. Note the subtle difference in the notation where ___vectors___ are in bold italic, while _scalars_ are only in italic.\n",
    "\n",
    "These kinds of expressions can be rendered in your notebook by creating __markdown cells__ and populating them with the proper expressions. Normally, a cell in a Jupyter notebook is for some code that you would like for the interpreter to execute, but there is a drop-down menu at the top of the current notebook which can change the mode of the current cell to either _Code_, _Markdown_, or _Raw_ (it will say _Code_ by default). We will rarely use _Raw_ cells, but the _Code_ and _Markdown_ types are both quite useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "To render both of the two expressions above, you will need to create a markdown cell, and then enter the following code into the cell:\n",
    "```\n",
    "$y = \\sum_{i=1}^{N}{w_i x_i + b}$\n",
    "$y = \\boldsymbol{w}\\boldsymbol{x}+b$\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You should notice first that each expression is surrounded by a set of \\\\$ symbols. Any text that you type between two \\\\$ symbols is rendered using $\\LaTeX$ mathematics mode. $\\LaTeX$ is a complete document preparation system that we will learn more about later in the semester. For now, the important thing to understand is that it has a special mode and markup language used to render mathematical expressions, and this markup language is supported in _markdown_ cells in Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, you can see that special mathematical symbols such as summation, $\\sum$, can be rendered using the \"sum\" escape sequence (\\sum) where \\ is the math mode escape character. There are numerous different escape sequences that can be used in math mode, each representing a common mathematical symbol or operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, you can see that symbols can be attached to other symbols for rendering as sub- or super-scripts by using the _ and ^ operators, respectively. You can also use curly-braces (liberally) to group symbols together into these sub- or super-scripts and the curly-braces, themselves, will not be rendered in the equation. These curly-brace delimeters only help the math mode interpreter understand which symbols you would like grouped together, and won't be displayed unless escaped.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it is clear that many symbols are rendered in a way that makes intuitive sense. For example, the bias term, $b$, is simply provided with no markup. Any text __not__ escaped or otherwise marked up will be rendered as a standard scalar (plain italic). However, the `\\mathrm{}` sequence can be used to render standard (roman) text when required. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "`$a\\ \\mathrm{plus}\\ b$`\n",
    "\n",
    "$a\\ \\mathrm{plus}\\ b$\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice also how a backslash followed by a space will add a space between the words or symbols. Normally, when two scalars are presented, it is assumed they are being multiplied together, and are placed closely together to represent this fact. Therefore, since spaces normally would _not_ be desired between symbols/variables in mathematical expressions, we must include them explicitly ourselves when using math mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you have a new mathematical symbol that you need to use, going to the documentation will help you find it. There is link in the __Reference Material__ section at the end of this lab to a comprehensive Here are a few other example expressions and their corresponding $\\LaTeX$ code:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The following is an example of a matrix decomposition (while bold lower-case variables indicate vectors, bold upper-case variables indicate matrices):\n",
    "\n",
    "`$\\boldsymbol{A}=\\boldsymbol{U}\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}\\boldsymbol{V}^\\top$`\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\boldsymbol{A}=\\boldsymbol{U}\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}\\boldsymbol{V}^\\top$ \n",
    "\n",
    "* Greek letters are also commonly used in mathematical expressions. For neural networks, many _hyperparameters_ (values that are tuned by the programmer to improve network performance) are often rendered as such. All Greek letters can be rendered in either upper- or lower-case form:\n",
    "\n",
    "`$\\alpha \\beta \\Theta \\Omega$`\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\alpha \\beta \\Theta \\Omega$\n",
    "\n",
    "* Many mathematical operators make special use of the sub- and super-script syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "`$\\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} \\sin{x}\\ dx$`\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} \\sin{x}\\ dx$\n",
    "\n",
    "`$\\prod_{i=1}^{N}{(x_i+y_i)^2}$`\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\prod_{i=1}^{N}{(x_i+y_i)^2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "* Rendering fractions requires an operator which accepts two arguments, each in a set of curly braces, to define the upper and lower parts of the expression, respectively:\n",
    "\n",
    "`$f(x)=\\frac{1}{x^2}$`\n",
    "\n",
    "$f(x)=\\frac{1}{x^2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{d}{dx}f(x) = -\\frac{2}{x^3}$\n",
    "\n",
    "`$\\frac{d}{dx}f(x) = -\\frac{2}{x^3}$`"

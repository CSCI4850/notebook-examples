    "# General Sequence-to-Sequence Mappings\n",
    "\n",
    "Many times, we want to map an arbitrary length sequence to another arbitrary length sequence for a machine learning task. The most common example would be for machine translation where the number of characters/words used to encode a sentence in one language rarely matches with the number of characters/works used to encode a sentence with the same meaning in another language. Thus, the many-to-many mapping used by the simple recurrent network used in the previous example will not be approprite.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to accomplish this task, the most common architecture used at this time is the *encoder-decoder* framework. First, we build an *encoder* network which takes an arbitrary length input sequence, and encodes a distributed representation of that input sequence using the hidden layer of a recurrent network. This is similar to a standard many-to-many recurrent network, except there is no output layer for the encoder. Instead, the input sequence information is simply folded into the hidden layer activation pattern at each time step. Once the encoder finishes generating a *gestalt* representation of the input sequence (using a recurrent hidden layer), the hidden layer activations are fed into a *decoder* network which translates the *gestalt* representation into the corresponding output sequence using another recurrent hidden layer and time-distributed output layer. Special *start* and *stop* patterns are used to encode for the starting and ending points of target sequences during training, so the *decoder* network learns to indicate when it is ready to start and finish a particular output sequence. Using its two subnetworks, the encoder-decoder framework forms a general sequence-to-sequence learning framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to illustrate how to build and train an encoder-decoder network, we will utilize the parity task from the simple recurrent network example. Even though the sequence lengths are the same for both the input and output for this task, we can still utilize it to illustrate the core concepts involved. Also, we will be using long short-term memory for the recurrent layers of these networks to show their effectiveness at learning these kinds of tasks."

    "This encoding will necessarily make the problem easier to solve (0 is now mapped to a meaningful orthogonal dimension to the other symbols), but more importantly, it shows how each symbol in the input/output sequences needs an orthogonal dimension in the encoded form. Other distributed codes may also work, but high dot product similarity between vectors in the encoding chosen may affect the network's learning capabilities in unpredictable ways (more than likely negative). Also, it should be clear here that we don't even need to have the same *symbols* in the encoder and decoder networks. They can be arbitrary mappings in both time and space, which makes this a powerful, flexible approach.\n",
